<p>p1. Always play the first matchup determined by the setup game algorithm.</p>
<p>p2. Use an Hard AI to even up the game ratings. This includes ending up with an odd number of players.</p>
<p>p3. P3 aka the "Planned Pizza Protocol" determines the amount of pizzas that should be ordered:</p>
<ul>
    <li>N is Amount of eating people present</li>
    <li>S is Guaranteed slices per person</li>
    <li>P is Amount of ordered pizzas</li>
    <li>You are allowed to eat more than S pieces of pizza, but only if you are certain everyone else has gotten their share. Behave civilized.</li>
    <li>Formula:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>IF N > 3: <b><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot+Ceiling%5B4*n%2F8%5D+from+n%3D3+to+15">S = 4, P = Math.ceil(S * n / 8)</a></b></li>
        <li>IF N <= 3: <b>P = Andr√© or substitute dictator decides</b></li>
    </ul>

</ul>
